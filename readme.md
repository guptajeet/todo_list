## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

   First, download the project to your local machine.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo_list.git
   cd todo_list
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**

   Create a virtual environment to manage your Python packages.

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the Virtual Environment**

   Activate the virtual environment to use it.
